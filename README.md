Unity-Visual-novel-tools
This is a repository of all the usual tools and files I use when building a visual novel in Unity
my intention is to keep the original version of all these tools here so i can copy and change them as needed for different games

includes:
*CSVREADER.csv, scripts written in google spreadsheets can be converted to csvs, this program extracts all the relevant information as a dictionary

*Dialogue.csv, the basic structure for storing all the relevant info from the story script to be used in game 

you can see these tools used in:
